# steampunk-ninja-game
A Ruby platformer I'm working on with my friend Dan. Just a test really to try and re-learn Ruby.
A work in progress, not really likely to be updated any time soon. If you'd like to add on, feel free!
Currently run through console.

Features to be implemented in next build:
- Graphics (attempting to implement Ruby2D, will add when I figure that out)
- Arrow keys input
