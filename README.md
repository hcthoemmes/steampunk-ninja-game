# steampunk-ninja-game
A Ruby platformer I'm working on with my friend Dan. Just a test really to try and re-learn Ruby.
A work in progress, not really likely to be updated any time soon. If you'd like to add on, feel free!

Features to be implemented in next build:
- Graphics (going to start with ASCII through console and move from there)
- Arrow keys input
